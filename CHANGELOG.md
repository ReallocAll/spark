  `--only-ticks-over`, `--save-to-file`, `--comment`, and `--include-sleeping`.
- `/spark tps` and `/spark health`.
- Linux backend: `SIGPROF` sampler with cpptrace async-signal-safe stack capture and
  `dladdr` symbolization (module + RVA fallback for stripped frames).
- Windows backend: `SuspendThread` + `StackWalk64` capture with PDB symbolization.
